            <h2 className="title">Sleeping on the International Space Station: The Unknown Frontier of Sleep in Space</h2>

            <p className="article-text"><strong>Sleep in Space</strong></p><p className="article-text">Sleep is an essential physiological process that allows our bodies and minds to recharge and regenerate. However, for astronauts floating amidst the wonders of space, <u>sleep takes on a whole new (and weightless) dimension</u>. In the vast expanse of the cosmos, where Earth's gravity fades away, sleep becomes a fascinating interstellar odyssey.</p><p className="article-text">On the International Space Station (ISS), a microcosm of human life in space, astronauts experience the complexities of sleep like never before. Picture <strong>floating on a sleep bench with a few belts holding you to the bench</strong>, surrounded by the soft hum of life support systems and the tranquility of weightlessness and space itself. In this alien environment, <u>the concept of a "good night's sleep" is both a marvel and a challenge</u>.</p><p className="article-text">Microgravity presents unique obstacles for our spacefaring companions. With no gravity to anchor them, astronauts may find themselves gently drifting off, hence why they need to <u>strap themselves down in order to try to get some sleep</u>. Astronauts commonly experience <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35023565/" target="_blank" className="link">short sleep durations</a> in spaceflight (&lt;6 h). In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35023565/" target="_blank" className="link">one study</a> with astronauts, the adverse consequences of short sleep were observed across neurobehavioral functions, where sleep durations &lt;6 h were associated with significant reductions in psychomotor response speed, elevated stress, and higher workload. Conversely and expectedly, a study showed that <u>longer sleep durations had beneficial effects on astronaut neurobehavioral functions</u>.&nbsp;</p><p className="article-text">Night or day loses its traditional meaning in the ever-rotating dance of the ISS around the Earth. The sun rises and sets <strong>sixteen times a day</strong> (yes, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/09/sun-international-space-station/626611/" target="_blank" className="link">16</a>!), and the notion of a <u>typical sleep-wake cycle fades into the void of space</u>. Yet, amidst this cosmic lullaby, NASA and other space agencies conduct extensive research on sleep in space, seeking to understand the interplay between sleep and the wonders of the universe.</p><p className="article-text">What about the structure of sleep in space? <u>Humans on Earth go through stages of deep and shallow sleep, as well as rapid eye movement (REM) stage</u>. One <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9125693/" target="_blank" className="link">study</a> found that the latent period of the first REM phase was short, and slow-wave sleep (deep sleep) was redistributed between the first and the second sleep cycles. They also reported that one astronaut had extended sleep latency and poor sleep efficiency, which was defined as “<strong>space insomnia</strong>”. What’s more, they found that <u>REM sleep time in space was reduced by 50%</u> compared to that of preflight, and the <u>overall sleep time was 27% less than that before the flight</u>. So if they sleep less, the logical presumption would be that astronauts on the ISS may experience significant sleep disruption. In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5975626/" target="_blank" className="link">1999</a>, NASA reviewed 219 records (each record represented one crewmember) from 79 shuttle missions, 94% of crewmembers had used medications, and <u>45% of crewmembers used drugs to solve the sleep disorder</u>. Another <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5975626/" target="_blank" className="link">study</a> pointed to 78% (61/78) of the crews of space shuttle missions in <u>52% (500/963) of the nights took a dose of drugs to promote sleep</u>. The conclusion seems to be clear – space is not the friendliest environment for human sleep. &nbsp;</p><p className="article-text">In the realm of space, where the laws of gravity no longer govern, the challenges of achieving a good night’s sleep are evident. <strong>Astronauts face unique obstacles </strong>as they float weightlessly, gently drifting in their sleep pods amidst the hum of life support systems. Studies have shown that short sleep durations in spaceflight can lead to adverse consequences on neurobehavioral functions, while longer sleep durations have beneficial effects. The ever-changing dance of day and night aboard the ISS blurs the lines of the traditional sleep-wake cycle, presenting a cosmic lullaby that NASA and space agencies diligently study to comprehend the intricacies of sleep in space. Ongoing <u>research and innovations will undoubtedly lead to improved methods to embrace sleep</u> amidst the stars, all while exploring the boundaries of the great unknown that is space.</p>
